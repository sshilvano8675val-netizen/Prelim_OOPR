// ACTIVITY 1
// • Problem Solving(Complete this activity using [1]- if else statement and [2]-switch case statement):
// 1)Your Professor is busy grading other students in her CS Department. She needs your help to grade her students in the Programming section that she teaches by creating a program in Java. Determine the grades of her students by following the rules below:
// 1) Grade her student ‘A’ if their average score is between 90 and 100.
// 2) Grade her student ‘B’ if their average score is between 80 and 89.
// 3) Grade her student ‘C’ if their average score is between 75 and 79.
// 4) Grade her student ‘F’ if their average score is below 74.
// • Input Instruction:
// 1) Take input of the student’s Java Programming score.
// 2) Take input of the student’s C Programming score.
// 3) Take input of the student’s Database Handling score.
